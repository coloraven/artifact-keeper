# Bootstrap Dependency-Track: change default password and provision API key.
# Runs as an init container, writes the API key to a shared volume.
#
# Requires: curl, jq (use alpine/curl + apk add jq, or similar)
# Idempotent: safe to run multiple times.
#
# Bug #978: Dependency-Track 4.x no longer exposes existing key material on
# `GET /api/v1/team`. Only `maskedKey` is returned for previously-created
# keys. The unmasked key is only ever returned in the response body of
# `POST /api/v1/team/<uuid>/key`. We must therefore *create* a fresh key
# and capture the response, rather than try to read an existing one.
#
# Idempotence strategy: on each run we delete every existing key on the
# Automation team (using `publicId` from the GET listing) and then POST a
# new one. This keeps the team to a single active key across reruns and
# prevents accumulation across helm upgrades.
