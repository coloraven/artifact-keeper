# v1.5.8 Release Integrity Incident — 2026-07-15

**Status:** Containment in progress

**Related baseline:** `docs/audits/release-assurance-baseline-2026-07-15.md`

## Summary

The `v1.5.8` Git tag was used for two different source commits. Both release
workflow runs failed their required full release gate, but a public GitHub
Release existed and the second run replaced every attached binary with a
different build.

The container set also has an identity gap. Backend, web, and OpenSCAP have
application-version tags, while scanner-adapter is independently versioned as
`1.2.0`. Its exact semver tag was later moved by a `main` build without a
version bump, so it no longer identifies the adapter built by the v1.5.8 tag
run.

## Timeline

All timestamps are UTC on 2026-07-15 unless noted.

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 18:47 | Release run `29441967462` started for `v1.5.8` at source `69994531eb7bd223cc8e073471e692c8586e6688` |
| 19:34 | Its aggregate full release gate failed |
| 19:55 | Its release job completed after building five binaries; failed gates caused draft intent |
| 22:13 | A second tag event started release run `29454678955` for the same `v1.5.8` name at different source `97680d2875f5110febe90001f63080252247aece` |
| 22:57 | The second aggregate full release gate failed |
| 23:05:14 | GitHub records release `354677069` as published |
| 23:11 | The second run's final binary build completed |
| 23:12 | The second release job requested `draft: true`, found the existing release, deleted all prior assets, and uploaded replacements while the release remained public |

The organization audit-log API returned HTTP 404 for the authenticated
organization administrator, so the canonical audit event was unavailable.
Corroborating event evidence is mixed but useful:

- The repository `ReleaseEvent` records action `published` with actor/author
  `github-actions[bot]` at 23:05:14.
- The release-triggered `Sync OpenAPI Spec` run (`29457482883`) records
  `triggering_actor=brandonrc` and started at 23:05:16.

This is consistent with publication of an action-created draft through an
authenticated user interaction, but the unavailable organization audit event
prevents treating that inference as definitive.

## Gate results for the second tag event

Required failures:

- Pinned vulnerable-image efficacy: Trivy database fetch unauthorized.
- Lifecycle: unbound `LAYER_DIGEST` in OCI GC mark-sweep.
- Platform: metrics endpoint/series assertions failed.
- Aggregate `collect-results`: failed.

Additional red evidence:

- Security: 71 tests passed, 1 failed; job was soft-failing.
- Mesh: registration/failover failures; job was optional.
- Docker publication verification: expected a nonexistent scanner-adapter
  `1.5.8` tag even though the component's declared version was `1.2.0`.

## Binary replacement evidence

The first run's retained workflow artifacts and the current public release
contain different SHA-256 checksums for every binary.

| Asset | First tag run (`69994531`) | Current public release (`97680d2`) |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact-keeper-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` | `d65a4e2642a0908c576edbba7243632993c402d90ff490dd911d5154c684255e` | `d43f29d170ba50ee7cd0ec22b130e831ce5cdfb0243694597a1b8ffafcff8340` |
| `artifact-keeper-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` | `bd3979d16abf5c526ce04f5bc63faa7297959fb2236588fd183582e94d656a80` | `a9638d24d8e7801d0e34be82874d5e228c9baf8ca6c2fd5a8cd460b79d987166` |
| `artifact-keeper-linux-amd64.tar.gz` | `29bef4a091f633c2ac2e0c320fc21f9b622e46a1bb80f97757c21fec87035096` | `63bc1604454418e0fd0a290d90ed99311d5617fba6673159bde03fe7b0c635c7` |
| `artifact-keeper-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | `cf9f7fe717bba377f05114b04438b89b31bd1eadf7c098291a391b59bcf20482` | `bf62a1aab18fe7ea47d9432295509c3839378bcd16fe5c5a1cc6741851fe4a3d` |
| `artifact-keeper-windows-amd64.exe` | `4e646c4ddff3270c12b97ad8ce477b385353e8945c55d7549afc14b75a782675` | `844500e9c0f768472cba6fd9271f55e1b5446588c48bdbede32fe058f5887373` |

The release action had `overwrite_files: true` by default/effective behavior.
Its log explicitly shows deletion of the ten existing binary/checksum assets
before replacement.

## Registry digest inventory

Registry manifests were resolved directly with OCI-index accept headers. GHCR
and Docker Hub agreed for every currently resolvable tag.

| Component/tag | Current digest in both registries |
|---|---|
| Backend `1.5.8` | `sha256:741f1d89ea2e435fb9bd8247d2429d6033318ec4ee5f21dc5895b42004facbf4` |
| OpenSCAP `1.5.8` | `sha256:16fc6d6beb4242487e87a115c68e0574f845fc5a2f2a71653bb6a7d210cc494f` |
| Web `1.5.8` | `sha256:3d19838cd0885a2c13f99d05450bdf41ece714c78d79fc2777f824b17d8300cd` |
| Scanner adapter `1.2.0` / `1` | `sha256:2df0e935f367f9749d50a4181bb8238c70fccdf8e8fe8479d8aa80540d0d3467` |

The v1.5.8 Docker publication log proves scanner-adapter `1.2.0` originally
resolved to:

`sha256:5aa1488c8ff917ff957ed4635ecaa4ee19552e39ac36d636c9da01068614e286`

A later `main` build moved `1.2.0`, `1.2`, `1`, and `latest` to
`sha256:2df0e935...` while `docker/scanner-adapter/VERSION` remained `1.2.0`.
The exact semver tag therefore does not currently provide immutable component
identity.

## Root control failures

1. Tag updates/deletion were not prevented, so one version named two commits.
2. Binary builds explicitly continued after full release-gate failure.
3. The release job ran after failed gates and relied on a draft flag as its
   only publication control.
4. A retry found an existing public release and overwrote its assets despite
   requesting draft mode.
5. Stable container publication was independent of the release verdict.
6. Scanner-adapter exact semver tags were republished from `main`.
7. One Docker verifier assumed application semver for an independently
   versioned component. This verifier was corrected on `main` by `ee862db1`,
   but the component-tag immutability issue remains.

## Containment actions

### Outstanding prerequisite: a tag ruleset

**No workflow control in this list makes a version tag immutable, and none can.**
A workflow only sees a tag push after the ref has already changed, and GitHub
reports a delete-then-recreate as a brand-new ref (`created=true`,
`forced=false`) — indistinguishable from a first-time tag. The workflow guards
below reject a *force-push* over a live tag and refuse to overwrite already
published releases and image tags, which contains the observed failure and
removes its blast radius. They do not prevent one version from naming two
commits.

Closing that requires a repository **ruleset** restricting **updates and
deletions** on `refs/tags/v*` — a repository setting an administrator applies.
Until it exists, every guarantee below is "the pipeline refuses to act on a
changed tag", not "the tag cannot change".

- [ ] **Protect version tags from update and deletion with a repository
      ruleset.** Prerequisite for the immutability claims in this document.

### Applied in the publication workflows

- [x] Require exact release-gate success before building release binaries.
- [x] Require exact required-gate success before invoking the release action.
- [x] Refuse to create or update a release when its tag already has a release
      object.
- [x] Disable release-asset overwrite.
- [x] Reject moved/force-pushed tag events in both publication workflows.
      Delete-and-recreate is not detectable here; see the ruleset prerequisite
      above.
- [x] Refuse to publish an exact version tag that either registry already
      serves (backend, openscap, scanner-adapter), so a recreated tag cannot
      replace a published image even though the tag event itself looks new.
- [x] Stop publishing scanner-adapter semver/stable tags from `main`.
- [x] Refuse to move an existing scanner-adapter exact semver tag to a new
      digest; require a VERSION bump. Floating tags (`1.2`, `1`, `latest`) still
      follow an unchanged-source rebuild so Alpine errata reach the
      chart-pinned tags (#2391).
- [x] Bump scanner-adapter to `1.2.1` because `1.2.0` moved and its current
      manifest lacks immutable source-revision metadata.
- [ ] Add a visible v1.5.8 integrity notice and supersede it with a new version
      after required gates pass.

## Evidence retention

- First run artifacts were downloaded to
  `/tmp/ak-v158-first-run-29441967462` during investigation.
- Current public checksum files were downloaded to
  `/tmp/ak-v158-current-release-checksums`.
- Workflow logs and GitHub-hosted artifacts remain the source of record; `/tmp`
  copies are investigative conveniences only.
