//! Cryptographic verification of publisher attestations (#2955).
//!
//! Makes `publisher_trust match:attestation` mean what it says: `verified=true`
//! is set **only** after the full provenance chain verifies. PyPI (PEP 740) is
//! supported; npm is ingested but recorded unsupported (see
//! [`NPM_UNSUPPORTED_REASON`]) — it never overclaims and stays on the shipped
//! fail-safe Flag.
//!
//! # What the crate does vs. what we do
//!
//! The verification is `sigstore` crate primitives, fail-closed at every step,
//! but two checks are **our** code because the crate does not do them (or does
//! them misleadingly) — this is exactly the hand-rolled-crypto-defect class the
//! issue exists to prevent, so it is called out explicitly:
//!
//! | Check | Who |
//! |---|---|
//! | DSSE envelope signature | crate (`verify_digest`) |
//! | Fulcio certificate chain | crate (`verify_digest`) |
//! | SCT (signed certificate timestamp) | crate (`verify_digest`) |
//! | Certificate validity at Rekor integrated time | crate (`verify_digest`) |
//! | **Rekor inclusion proof + signed checkpoint** | **us** ([`rekor_glue`]) — the crate's `verify_digest` skips it (`TODO(tnytown)` in 0.14.0 and git main; it accepts forged proofs) |
//! | **OIDC issuer allowlist** | **us** — the crate's `policy::AnyOf` is secretly an AND, so we iterate the allowlist |
//! | **Certificate identity extraction** | **us** ([`identity`]) — the crate exposes only assertion policies, never the parsed identity, and reads only Fulcio's deprecated `1.1` extensions |
//! | **Subject-digest binding** | **us** — the crate reports a misleading `Transparency` error; our compare distinguishes replay from a bad signature |
//! | **Claimed-publisher owner binding** | **us** — cert-bound owner must equal the self-asserted `publisher.repository` owner |
//!
//! Both `verify_digest` **and** the Rekor inclusion glue must pass. A structural
//! guard ([`AttestationVerdict::from_mask`]) makes "every check actually ran" an
//! asserted property of *our* code, not an assumption about the crate's.
//!
//! # Known residual: `integratedTime` is not authenticated
//!
//! The Signed Entry Timestamp is the field that binds a Rekor entry's
//! `integratedTime`, and nothing verifies it — `verify_digest` skips it
//! (`TODO(tnytown) SET verification` in 0.14.0) and the inclusion glue does not
//! cover it either, because the SET is not part of `canonicalizedBody` and not
//! part of the Merkle leaf. So the `integratedTime` that
//! [`Check::CryptoAndChain`] compares against the certificate's validity window
//! is a value the bundle's author chose, and that comparison is trivially
//! satisfiable.
//!
//! This is not a practical bypass: satisfying it still requires a Fulcio leaf
//! certificate whose SAN and source-repository extensions name the claimed
//! publisher, which is the property [`Check::PublisherOwnerBound`] actually
//! turns on. What it does mean is that the "cert was valid when it signed"
//! check is corroborating evidence rather than an independent guarantee — do not
//! describe it as a verified timestamp. Closing it means verifying the SET
//! against the Rekor log key, which the crate does not expose primitives for;
//! tracked as a follow-up.
