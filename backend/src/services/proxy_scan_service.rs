//! Digest-keyed proxy scan verdict store (#2954).
//!
//! Proxy-cached bytes are deliberately NOT written to `artifacts` (#1278/#1280),
//! so the `artifact_id`-keyed `scan_results` pipeline cannot hold a verdict for
//! a proxied object. This service persists a content-addressed
//! (`checksum_sha256`) verdict in `proxy_scan_results`, independent of
//! `artifacts`, so that:
//!
//!   * a repeat pull of a known-vulnerable digest is blocked WITHOUT re-fetching
//!     upstream or re-scanning (the fast path), and
//!   * a verdict is shared across repos/tenants pulling identical bytes (same
//!     bytes = same CVEs) and survives proxy-cache eviction.
//!
//! The freshness and fail-open/closed decision logic lives in pure functions so
//! it is unit-testable without a database.
