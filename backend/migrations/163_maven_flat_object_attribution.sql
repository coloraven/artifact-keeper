-- Repository attribution for row-less Maven flat-key objects (#2574, #2584).
--
-- #2504 closed a cross-tenant read hole on shared cloud namespaces
-- (S3/GCS/Azure) by refusing to serve any bare `maven/{path}` key that is not
-- anchored to an artifact row scoped to the requesting repository. That also
-- broke legitimate reads of *row-less* legacy objects that never had a row of
-- their own -- GAV-grouped companion files (`.pom`, `.module`, `-sources.jar`),
-- verbatim `maven-metadata.xml`, and stored checksum sidecars -- because a
-- row-less object on a flat namespace carries no inherent repository
-- attribution, so a catalog lookup alone cannot tell "my legacy file" from
-- "another tenant's".
--
-- This table records, per flat storage key, the single repository that owns the
-- physical object, derived entirely from the catalog (no bucket/storage
-- listing). A key is attributed only when the database proves a single owner;
-- ambiguous (multi-owner) keys and truly-orphan objects are intentionally left
-- UNATTRIBUTED (no row) so they stay 404 for every tenant on cloud backends.
-- Reads consult this table (plus live rows) to serve a legacy object only to
-- its genuine owner; writes consult it to refuse cross-repository overwrites and
-- to claim previously-unowned keys first-writer-wins.
